# AIPND-Image-Classifier
This is the image classifier project that I completed for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. 
The ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook that contains my code for setting up and training a neural network, as well as using the neural network to predict the type of a flower. 
The two py files are a command line application that allow the classifier to use user inputs. The user can specify the architecture of the neural network, directory for the image files, number of epochs and learning rate for the neural network, the device to use for training (gpu or cpu), as well as the number of possible flower types and corresponding probabilities to output.
